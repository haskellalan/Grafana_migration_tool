This tool is designed to migrate Grafana dashboards from a source instance to a destination instance. 
It allows users to easily transfer dashboard configurations and settings, including data sources, panels, and visualizations, from one Grafana environment to another. 

This can be useful for organizations that are upgrading their Grafana installations, moving to a new server, or simply trying to replicate dashboards across multiple instances.
